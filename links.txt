Talking about kubernetes
make use of profs read me file to install.
use the first script for both the master and the slave nodes
for the master nodes, complete the whole scripts , log out from root user and perform the remaining tasks.
for the slave users make sure you run the kubeadm init in the master and get your token, add that token to the script for the worker nodes
